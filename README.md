# Exploit-DB-RSS-Feed-Parser
Python3 scripts to parse the Exploit-DB RSS Feed

Stage 1

gsa_basic.py prints out base entries from the Exploit-DB RSS Atoma feed

edb_advanced.py extracts key Atoma elements such as Title, Published, Link, Attack Description and Type and Vector and parses any special characters ('[],') and stores the results in a CSV file.

edb_advanced_proxy.py supports proxy requests, extracts key Atoma elements such as Title, Published, Link, Attack Description and Type and Vector and parses any special characters ('[],') and stores the results in a CSV file.

Stage 2

The goal is to create a MISP CSV import feed by hosting the CSV file as an accessible web feed on a local server.

Make the downloaded feed accessible as a CSV or HTML file.
